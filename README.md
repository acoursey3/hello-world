Hello World for CSC430

My name is Austin Coursey. I am a 3rd year math and computer science major. 
I like to play games, mess around with Rubik's cubes, and hang out with friends for fun. I also do a bit of web development using Angular and a .NET web api for my internship with United Systems and Software.
